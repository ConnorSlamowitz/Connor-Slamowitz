This is the official portfolio for Connor Slamowitz. I was born in Glen Allen, Virginia, a suburb of Richmond. I currently reside in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where I study Materials Science in the department of **Applied Physical Sciences** at the **University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill**. I work under [Prof. Scott Warren](http://2d-lab.com/) researching the fundamental mechanisms of next-generation battery components. My interests lie in the adoption of interdisciplinary sciences to solve society's most pressing problems.

### Research Goals

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
