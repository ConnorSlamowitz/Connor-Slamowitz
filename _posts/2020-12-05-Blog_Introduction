Hello! Welcome to my blog! I apologize if this is not as creative as other blogs, but perhaps that can change as time goes. 
This post serves as formal, albeit ambitious, introduction to a non-"professional" section of my portfolio.
I will dedicated this area to developing mini projects that I may be working on. 

As a graduate student endearing a PhD, I may not have too much time to dedicate to one-off projects. However, that does not mean I can't have some fun every now and then. 
Join me as I sporatically update this blog with coding projects, CAD Design/3D Printing, engineering, entrepreneurial, and ramblings about our possible futures.
