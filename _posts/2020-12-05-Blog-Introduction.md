title: Blog Introduction
---

Hello! Welcome to my blog! I apologize if this is not as creative as other blogs, but perhaps that can change as time goes on. 
This post serves as formal, albeit ambitious, introduction to a non-"professional" section of my portfolio.
I will dedicate this area to developing mini projects that I may be working on. 

As a graduate student enduring a PhD, I may not have too much time to attempt one-off projects. However, that does not mean I can't have some fun every now and then. 
Join me as I sporatically update this blog with coding projects, CAD/3D Printing, engineering, entrepreneurship, and ramblings about our possible futures.
