## PhD Productivity Hacking

I would consider myself a novice at programming. I have done courses in python, web development, database management, and object oriented programming, but I would
never really feel comfortable doing anything more than making pretty graphs with Plotly or organizing data with Pandas. However, I do often find myself lurking on
the [machine learning subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning)to see what more talented programmers can do with modern architectures. It's actually pretty
cool to see the projects current ML researchers are working on. I have seen tools that can convert HD pictures into [Van Gogh paintings](https://towardsdatascience.com/style-transfer-with-gans-on-hd-images-88e8efcf3716), 
video processing applications that can [convert 15 FPS videos into 60 FPS videos](https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20200121-dain-app/), and even applications that utilize
GPT-3 to [generate ideas for blogs](https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/10/22/this-gpt-3-powered-tool-generates-new-ideas-for-your-terrible-blog/) (could this just be an instance
of auto-generated robot vomit?)
