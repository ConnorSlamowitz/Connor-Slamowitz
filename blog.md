## Synopsis of the Paper
This pioneering study investigates the impact of uniaxial stack pressure on the efficacy of nanocrystalline electrolytes and electrode composites in the innovative realm of all-solid-state fluoride-ion batteries (ASS-FIBs). The research uncovers that the application of pressure is not merely beneficial but essential for enhancing cyclic stability and energy efficiency by promoting consistent inter-particle contact, a key factor in maintaining superior battery performance.

## Key Methods
The researchers employed a multifaceted approach to explore this phenomenon, which included:

- Constructing a custom hot press tailored for solid-state battery operation.
- Synthesizing nanocrystalline electrolytes via high-energy ball milling techniques.
- Utilizing solid-state synthesis for electrode material production.
- Performing galvanostatic cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to meticulously evaluate ionic conductivity.

## Key Results
The study's findings are pivotal for future battery technology development. The results indicate that:

- Stack pressure significantly improves the batteries' cycle life and efficiency.
- Ionic conductivity is enhanced with increasing pressure up to a certain threshold, beyond which it deteriorates due to microstructural changes.
- Ba0.6La0.4F2.4 electrolyte showcases the lowest activation volume, hinting at superior ionic conduction with minimal structural deformation.

## Key Conclusions
The researchers advocate for a paradigm shift in the assessment of ASS-FIBs, emphasizing that:

- Cell design is crucial for optimizing battery performance.
- Previous evaluations of the reversibility of fluoride materials may have been underestimated due to cell engineering constraints.
- A deeper understanding of material-specific characteristics and their interaction with battery design is essential for technological advancements.

## Additional Insights
The article stands out for its novel approach to battery research and suggests that pressure isn't just a variable but a vital tool to unlock the potential of solid-state batteries. It opens up new horizons in battery research, offering a glimpse into the meticulous processes that could define the future of energy storage solutions.

# Counting Electrons in Electrides
**By Samuel M. Weaver, Jack D. Sundberg, Connor C. Slamowitz, Rebecca C. Radomsky, Matthew G. Lanetti, Lauren M. McRae, and Scott C. Warren. Published in Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2023**

## Synopsis
This article introduces a novel algorithm, BadELF, designed to address the challenge of quantifying bare electrons in electrides, materials with extreme properties including high electrical conductivity, efficient reduction of N2 and CO2, ultra-fast ion transport for batteries, and ultra-low work-function electron emitters.

## Key Methods
The BadELF algorithm partitions the charge based on the electron localization function (ELF), a popular scheme for visualizing chemically important features in molecules and solids. The algorithm uses two key techniques: Bader segmentation of the ELF to find the electride electrons and Voronoi segmentation of the ELF to identify atoms.

## Key Results
When applied to ionic compounds and electrides, the BadELF method yielded results that agree closely with Shannon crystal radii, while oxidation states agree closely with the Bader method. In the case of electrides, only the BadELF algorithm yields chemically meaningful charges.

## Key Conclusions
The authors argue that the BadELF method provides a useful strategy to identify electrides and gain new insight into their most essential property: the quantity of electrons within them. The algorithm was benchmarked against the Bader method using a selection of 157 ionic crystals and demonstrated good agreement.

## Additional Insights
Despite its promising results, the authors note some limitations of the algorithm, including a systematic tendency for BadELF to yield oxidation states that are slightly larger than Bader. They suggest that the algorithm could be further refined to automate the analysis.

This research represents a significant step forward in understanding electrides and their unique properties, offering exciting possibilities for future applications in various fields.
